## Project Description
Face Recognition is a technology in computer vision. In Face recognition / detection we locate and visualize the human faces in digital images.
In Object Detection, I observe the instance of semantic objects. These objects are of particular class such as animals, cars, humans, etc. Face Detection technology has importance in many fields like marketing and security.


## Required Packages:

- Python
- numpy
- dlib
- cv2
- face_recognition
- pickle

## How To Run:
-> Run Identification.py for face detection through camera.
  
-> Run Encode.py to pre-define faces recognized. then run Recognition.py for Recognition through camera.

__PS: If you have a problem with camera setup re-adjust camera port to your in Identification.py or Recognition.py.__
